# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Internationalization

I'm created this app for learning more about react internationalization. I'm used i18n library javascript to translate our app to other languages we want.

You can check it in the [package.json](./package.json) file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
